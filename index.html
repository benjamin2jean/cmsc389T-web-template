                    <h2>Project 1: Simulating a Virus</h2>
                    <p>In this project, myself and a couple of teammates worked together to model a virus that tries to infect as many people as possible while trying to stay undetected. We gave the virus the ability to mutate over a series of stages; this was done because if the virus became too deadly that would hinder the virus' goal to infect the most amount of people as possible as the people that were infected were dying faster than they were infecting others. The virus could also add other symptoms such as a running nose, cough, etc. to help masquerade itself to prevent detection.</p>

                    <h2>Project 2: Perceptron</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I alongside my teammates worked on a perceptron to help model learning in our machine learning class, we add the ability to do learning with training examples or without training examples.</p>

                    <h2>Project 3: PokerTracker</h2>
                    <p>In this project, myself and some teamates worked on a mobile application to help users to keep track of the wins and losses across various games at a casino. Our application worked with cloud storage so that users can access their info from different devices as long as they sign into their account. I was in charge for the construction and layout of the various pages as well as the graphics displayed.</p>
